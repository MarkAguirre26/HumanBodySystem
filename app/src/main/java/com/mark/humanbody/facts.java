They do appear longer when we die, however, as the skin dehydrates and pulls back from the nail beds and scalp.", " By the age of 60, most people will have lost about half their taste buds. Perhaps you shouldn’t trust your grandmas cooking as much as you do. Older individuals tend to lose their ability to taste, and many find that they need much more intense flavoring in order to be able to fully appreciate a dish.", " Your eyes are always the same size from birth but your nose and ears never stop growing.

While we might typically think that urine is the liquid part of human waste products, the  truth is that what we consider solid waste is actually mostly water as well.

While you might feel better prepared to stay up all night partying than to give up eating, that feeling will be relatively short lived. Provided there is water, the average human could survive a month to two months without food depending on their body fat and other factors.

Hair diameter also varies on average between races, making hair plugs on some men look especially obvious.", "One human hair can support 3.5 ounces. That about the weight of two full size candy bars, and with hundreds of thousands of hairs on the human head, makes the tale of Rapunzel much more plausible.", "The fastest growing nail is on the middle finger.

Those with ulcers know how painful it can be when stomach acid takes its toll on the lining of your stomach.", "The surface area of a human lung is equal to a tennis court. In order to more efficiently oxygenate the blood, the lungs are filled with thousands of branchingf bronchi and tiny , grape-like alveoli. These are filled with microscopic capillaries which oxygen and carbon dioxide. The large amount of surface area makes it easier for this exchange to take place, and makes sure you stay properly oxygenated at all times.", "Women hearts beat faster than means. The main reason for this is simply that on average women tend  to be smaller than men and have less mass to pump blood to. But womens and mens hearts can actually act quite differently, especially when experiencing trauma like a heart attack, and many treatments that work for men must be adjusted or changed entirelto work for women.", "Scientists have counted over 500 different liver functions.

Some of the functions your liver performs are: production of bile, decomposition of red blodd cells, plasma protein synthesis, and detoxification.", "The aorta is nearly the diameter of a garden hose.

The artery needs to ba a large as it is the main supplier of rich, oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.", "Your left lung is smaller than your right lung to make room for your heart.

The adrenal glands, lying right above the kidneys, are responsible for releasing stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. In the seventh month of a fetus development, the glands are roughly the same size as the kidneys. At birth, the glands have shrunk slightly and will continue to do so throughout life.

Each Tongue is different and yours could be unique enough to finger you as the culprit.", "Your body has enough iron in it to make a nail 3 inches long.

If you were to take all of this iron out of the body, you’d have enough to make a small nail and very severe anemia.", "The most common blood type in the world is type O. Blood banks find it valuable as it can be given to those with both type A and B blood. The rarest blood type, A-H or Bombay blood due to the location of its discovery, has been found in less than hundred people since it was discovered.", "Human lips have a reddish color because of the great concentration of tiny capillaries just below the skin. The blood in these capillaries is normally highly oxygenated and therefore quite red. This explains why the lips appear pale when a person is anemic or has lost a great deal of blood. It also explains why the lips turn blue in very cold weather. Cold causes the capillaries to constrict, and the blood loses oxygen and changes to a darker color."};

Our bodies expend a large amount of calories keeping us at a steady 98.6 degrees, enough to boil water or even cook pasta.", "Your ear secrete more earwax when you are afraid than when you aren’t. The chemicals and hormones released when you are afraid could be having unseen effects on your body in the form of earwax. Studies have suggested that fear causes the ears to produce more of the sticky substance, though the reasons are not yet clear.", "It is not possible to tickle yourself. Even the most ticklish among us do not have the ability to tickle ourselves. The reason behind this is that your brain predicts the tickle from information it already has, like how your fingers are moving. Because it knows and can feel where the tickle is coming from, your brain doesn’t respond in the same way as it would if someone else was doing the tickling.", "The width of your arm span stretched out is the length of your whole body.

In the animal world, humans are the biggest crybabies, being the only animals who cry because they’ve  had a bad day, lost a loved one, or just don’t feel good.", "Right-Handed People live, on average, nine years longer than left-handed people do. This doesn’t have a genetic basis, but is largely due to the fact that a majority of the machines and tools we use on a daily basis are designed for those who are right handed, making them somewhat dangerous for lefties to use and resulting in thousands of accidents and deaths each year.", "Women burn fat more slowly than men, by a rate of about 50 calories a day. Most men have a much easier time burning fat than women. Women, because of their Reproductive role, generally require a higher basic body fat proportion than men, and as a result their bodies don’t get rid of excess fat at the same rate as men.", "Koalas and primates are the only animals with unique fingerprints. Humans, apes and koalas are unique in the animal kingdom due to the tiny prints on the fingers of their hands. Studies on primates have suggested that even cloned individuals have unique finger prints.", "The indentation in the middle of the area between the nose and the upper lip has a name.
